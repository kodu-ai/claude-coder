Interactive Personality Greeter and CTF Challenge

This script implements an engaging interactive questionnaire that demonstrates secure
blocking input handling while creating a fun and personalized experience for users.
It combines personality assessment with cryptographic concepts to generate a unique
CTF (Capture The Flag) token.

Key Features:
    - Deterministic question randomization based on file location
    - Secure token generation using SHA-256 hashing
    - Personalized responses based on user input
    - Age-appropriate engagement messages
    - Input validation and error handling

Security Aspects:
    - Uses file path as a deterministic seed for question ordering
    - Implements MD5 for seed generation (non-security critical)
    - Uses SHA-256 for token generation with a secret salt
    - Ensures consistent output flushing for reliable interaction

Example Usage:
    $ ./greeter
    Welcome to the Interactive Greeter!
    What's your name? Alice
    How old are you? 25
    ... (additional questions in random order)
    Congratulations! Here's your token: CTF_abc123def456

def get_user_info():
    """
    Manages the interactive questionnaire session and generates a CTF token.
    
    The function implements a deterministic yet randomized questioning system
    where the order of questions is based on the script's file location hash.
    It provides personalized responses and validates user input where appropriate.
    
    Returns:
        None: Prints interaction messages and final CTF token to stdout
    
    Security Notes:
        - Token generation uses SHA-256 with a secret salt
        - Question order is deterministic per installation
        - All outputs are flushed to ensure reliable interaction
