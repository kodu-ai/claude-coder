/*
The Node.js 'path' module resolves and normalizes paths differently depending on the platform:
- On Windows, it uses backslashes (\) as the default path separator.
- On POSIX-compliant systems (Linux, macOS), it uses forward slashes (/) as the default path separator.

While modules like 'upath' can be used to normalize paths to use forward slashes consistently,
this can create inconsistencies when interfacing with other modules (like vscode.fs) that use
backslashes on Windows.

Our approach:
1. We present paths with forward slashes to the AI and user for consistency.
2. We use the 'arePathsEqual' function for safe path comparisons.
3. Internally, Node.js gracefully handles both backslashes and forward slashes.

This strategy ensures consistent path presentation while leveraging Node.js's built-in
path handling capabilities across different platforms.

Note: When interacting with the file system or VS Code APIs, we still use the native path module
to ensure correct behavior on all platforms. The toPosixPath and arePathsEqual functions are
primarily used for presentation and comparison purposes, not for actual file system operations.

Observations:
- Macos isn't so flexible with mixed separators, whereas windows can handle both. ("Node.js does automatically handle path separators on Windows, converting forward slashes to backslashes as needed. However, on macOS and other Unix-like systems, the path separator is always a forward slash (/), and backslashes are treated as regular characters.")
